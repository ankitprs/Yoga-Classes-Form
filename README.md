# ⚡️ Yoga Class Form Full Stack Project ⚡️

This full-stack app boasts a dynamic ReactJS frontend, a robust ExpressJS backend, and a blazing-fast MySQL database with optimized queries. ‍♀️

## Database - MySQL

- O(1) Query Execution: Primary keys in every table ensure lightning-fast data retrieval, no matter the data volume. Say goodbye to lag, hello to smooth enrollment!
- Scalability Champion: Our database can handle an expanding community without breaking a sweat. Bring on the yogis!

#### ER Digram

While traditional ER principles often avoid this type of relationship, in pursuit of optimal performance, I chose to prioritize efficiency over strict adherence to conventions... because it allows for O(1) retrieval of related data, significantly enhancing query performance.
